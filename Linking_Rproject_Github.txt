I have linked an existing R project to a new GitHub repository. 
I followed these steps:
In RStudio…
Open the project that you would like have associated with a GitHub Repository
Select Tools from the menu bar, then click on Version control, and then Project Setup
In the Project Options window, select Git/SVN, and then select Git as the version control system in the drop-down menu
After selecting Git, a pop-up window will ask if you want to initialize a new git repository.
Select Yes, and then select Yes to restart the R Session
Upon restart, a new Git` tab will be available in the Environment pane
Under the Git tab, select the check boxes of the files to upload to a GitHub repository
Select the Commit button, type in a Commit message, select the Commit button, and then Close the new window
On Github…
Sign in to your account and navigate to your Repositories page
Then select the green New button, to create a new repository.
Type in a new repository name and select public or private, then select the green Create repository button.
Verify that “Add README” is not selected as this changes how to set up the repository
From here, copy the three lines of code from the section titled “… or push existing repository from the command line”
Windows
On a windows machine, set RStudio to open Git Bash terminals instead of Command Prompt or Windows Powershell
Go to Tools in the menu bar and select Terminal Options
Select Git Bash from the drop down menu, select Apply, then OK
You can then open a new terminal window by going to Tools, Terminal, New Terminal,
In the new terminal window, paste in the three commands from the GitHub page and press enter
